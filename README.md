# Instacart_Sales-Forecasting_Recommendation-System
In this project, I have analyzed the Instacart dataset using Python to perform exploratory data analysis and using Matplot and Seaborn built informative visualizations. In this project I built a recommendation system that combines multiple techniques: XGBoost for reorder prediction and K-Nearest Neighbors for collaborative filtering. Additionally, I implemented customer segmentation to generate tailored messages for each customer based on their spending patterns. Beyond that, I identified inactive customers and provided them with personalized recommendations by suggesting popular products based on the current day and time. For evaluation, I used precision as the primary performance metric, along with recall and F1-score.
